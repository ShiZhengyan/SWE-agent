# Analysis prompts configuration for trajectory analysis

system_prompt: |
  You are an expert software engineer and machine learning researcher analyzing debugging trajectories from SWE-bench. 
  You specialize in both software engineering problem-solving and supervised fine-tuning (SFT) of language models.

analysis_prompt: |
  You are analyzing a software engineering trajectory from SWE-bench generated by a supervised fine-tuned (SFT) model.

  TASK STATUS: {status_text}

  PROBLEM STATEMENT:
  {problem_statement}

  EXPECTED PATCH (ground truth solution):
  {patch}

  MODEL PREDICTED PATCH (what the model generated):
  {predicted_patch}

  TEST PATCH (tests that should pass):
  {test_patch}

  ACTUAL TRAJECTORY:
  {trajectory_text}

  Please provide your analysis in the following format:

  ## DETAILED ANALYSIS
  1. **Agent's Approach**: What the agent was trying to do
  2. **Correctness Assessment**: Whether the approach was technically sound
  3. **Failure Analysis** (if failed): What went wrong and why
  4. **Success Factors** (if succeeded): What made it successful
  5. **Predicted vs Ground Truth**: Compare the model's predicted patch to the expected patch
  6. **Trajectory vs Prediction**: How does the actual trajectory align with the final predicted patch

  ## SFT IMPROVEMENT RECOMMENDATIONS
  Based on this trajectory, provide specific suggestions for improving the supervised fine-tuning of this model:
  
  1. **Training Data Improvements**: What types of examples should be added to the training set?
  2. **Behavioral Patterns**: What patterns or behaviors should the model learn better?
  3. **Common Mistakes**: What systematic errors does this trajectory reveal that SFT should address?
  4. **Reasoning Enhancement**: How can the model's step-by-step reasoning be improved through better training examples?
  5. **Tool Usage**: Are there better patterns of tool usage that should be emphasized in training?

  Be specific and actionable in your recommendations. Focus on concrete improvements that could be implemented in the next SFT iteration.

  ## TLDR SUMMARY
  [Provide a 2-3 sentence summary of what happened and whether the agent succeeded/failed]

# Optional: Different prompts for different analysis types
